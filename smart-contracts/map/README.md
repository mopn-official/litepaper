MOPN Map is build with Hexagonal Grids. Hexagon is a 6-sides polygon which all the sides are the same length. Hexagon is a magic beautiful polygon, if you combine a certain number of Hexagon together, it also becomes a totally symmetrical polygon. So we also makes the pass blocks and the hole map a Hexagon.
