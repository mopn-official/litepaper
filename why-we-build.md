# Why We Build

### r/place

r/place is quite a successful activity held by Reddit on April Fool 2017. The rule is simple: every 5 mins, players can put a pixel on the board. The board is all white at the beginning, but with time past, all kinds of symbols and pictures are showing on the board. By the end of the activity, an epic painting drawn by millions of people together is right in front of us.

### MOPN

Enlightened by r/place, we came up with the idea of MOPN.&#x20;

The idea is to build an open map with simple rules. The map is 100% deployed on Ethereum, cannot be upgraded and any NFT holder is free to play.&#x20;

This is an open economic system driven by NFT holders, and an experiment in group decision-making gameplay within the NFT communities.&#x20;

Any NFT holder can play MOPN without the extra cost of buying new NFTs or Token.&#x20;

Holders from the same collection are fighting together for community glory and benefits. To occupy more blocks on the map, cooperation and confrontation will continuously happen within and out of the community.&#x20;

As a result, MOPN will become the observer and recorder of the evolution of NFT on Ethereum. The most topping NFTs and most influential holders are all recorded on MOPN.
