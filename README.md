## Account

1. Users use the wallet as their account to access MOPN.
2. The contract only checks NFT ownership in the wallet and can not authorize or transfer NFTs.
3. Supporting wallet delegate protocols such as [http://warm.xyz](https://t.co/WGWLQY9try) or [http://delegate.cash](https://t.co/Spha4pZXJp).
4. Only whitelisted collections can participate during the launch phase. After that, all NFTs can participate.

## Place

Users can place their own NFTs on MOPN map tiles. The territory is 7 tiles centered by the NFT placed on the map.

NFTs from the same collection form an alliance. Adjacent alliance territories can overlap, while territories from different alliances cannot overlap but can be adjacent.

After placing NFT, the $MT rewards are allocated to NFT holder, NFT collection vault, and land holder in a ratio of 90%, 5%, and 5%.

## Tile
