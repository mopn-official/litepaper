# Overview

1. MOPNï¼ŒMap Of PFP NFTs, is a dynamic map recording all the stories of the NFTverse. It is also a fully on-chain game, all logic and status are deployed on Ethereum Mainnet.
2. Players can interact with MOPN contract with ethereum wallet. NFTs from the same collection are treated as one alliance. The core gameplay is to occupy more blocks on the map for the alliance.
3. Occupied blocks are the region of the alliance. Regions generate tradable $ENERGY (ERC-20), which can also buy POM (ERC-1155, props in MOPN). The POM will gain advantages for avatars in the war of occupying more blocks.
4. MOPN will generate a dynamic map of all the NFT collections based on the region changing of each alliance. The changing process will be recorded on Ethereum.
5. MOPN will open source all the smart contracts and client codes. Anyone can directly interact with MOPN contracts using customized clients. After launching on Mainnet, there are no rights to upgrade or governance of MOPN contracts, which makes MOPN a **perpetual game** existing on Blockchain.
6. MOPN is still under development. Litepaper will keep updating during MOPN development. You are welcome to join MOPN's community to provide help and great ideas.
