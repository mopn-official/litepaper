# Economic System

The whole economic system of MOPN is driven by unupgradable contracts. And there are two main cycles of mint and burn of two Tokens, which are [$Energy](usdenergy/) (ERC-20) and [Prop](prop/)(ERC-1155).

[$Energy](usdenergy/) is generated by [Region](../how-to-play/map-system.md#region) (occupying blocks). [Props](prop/) are bought from [auction house](prop/prop-auction.md) using [$Energy](usdenergy/). $Energy will be 100% burn after buying Props.

Props are activated on the[ Block](../how-to-play/map-system.md#block), after using it will burn 100%. And the [Pass holder ](pass/)of the block will have 0-6% recycled $Energy based on the [Block level](usdenergy/block-level.md) and the price of the Prop. 1% will be recycled by the MOPN team as the protocol income to maintain development of MOPN.
