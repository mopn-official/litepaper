There are two main cycles of generation and burn of two Tokens in the main economic cycle of MOPN, which are [$ENERGY](usdenergy/) (ERC-20) and [Prop](prop/)(ERC-1155).

**$ENERGY Generation：**[$ENERGY](usdenergy/) is generated by alliance [regions](../how-to-play/map-system.md#region) automatically every day and equally distributed to avatars in the alliance.

**$ENERGY Burn--- Prop Issue：**[$ENERGY](usdenergy/) can buy [Props](prop/) in [Auction House](prop/prop-auction.md)，$ENERGY will be 100% burn after buying Props.

**Prop Burn——$ENERGY Recycle:**Props are activated on the [block](../how-to-play/map-system.md#block). After using it, it will burn 100%. And the [Pass](pass/) holder of the [block](../how-to-play/map-system.md#block) will recycle[ $ENERGY](usdenergy/) based on the [block level](../how-to-play/map-system.md#block-level).
