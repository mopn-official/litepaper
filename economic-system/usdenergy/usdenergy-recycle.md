# Recycle

Prop after using on the [block](../../how-to-play/map-system.md#block), will burn 100%. And the [Pass](../pass/) holder of the block will recycle $ENERGY based on the [block level](../../how-to-play/map-system.md#block-level).

* LPBP: The lowest price of burned prop in the past 10 days
* BLR: Block Level Recycle Ratio

1. The $ENERGY used not on the map will be given to the block Pass holder after the [avatar ](../../how-to-play/account-system.md#avatar)is placed on the map.
2. If the Pass of the block is not mint, recycled $ENERGY is still being calculated. Holder can recycle all the gathered $ENERGY after mint.；
