# Earn

$ENERGY is generated by alliance regions automatically every day and equally distributed to avatars in the alliance.

The output of each Block is associated with [Block Type](../../how-to-play/map-system.md#block-type) and [Level](../../how-to-play/map-system.md#block-level).

$$
ENERGY\space Earn=\dfrac{∑(RBA×BLG×BTR)}{NAA}
$$

* RBA (The Region Blocks of Alliance)
* BLG (The [Block Level](../../smart-contracts/pass-nft-collection/block-level.md) Generation)
* BTR ( [Block Type](../../how-to-play/map-system.md#block-type) Ratio):
* NAA (Number of Avatars in Alliance)
