# Tokenomics

$MT

$MT, an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 100 billion, serves as the value carrier for MOPN. The initial supply is 6,000 per block, and it decreases by 0.3% every 50,000 blocks.

All NFTs placed on tiles automatically receive $MT earnings per block based on their weight (requires manual claiming).

$MT is used to auction bombs and lands, with 100% of the $MT used for auction being burned.

### How to obtain

#### 1. Placing NFT Earnings

Users can earn $MT by placing their owned NFTs on unoccupied tiles on the MOPN map.

#### 3. Land Tax

Land NFT holders can permanently receive a 5% tax of the $MT generated by NFTs placed on it.

#### 4. BUY

Users can buy $MT on dex such as uniswap.

## Bomb

BOMB, a 100-token auction of an ERC-1155 token via LPDA per round, serves as the update mechanism for MONP.

Using BOMB can remove all NFTs on the 7 tiles centered around the placement point. The NFT used for bombing will not be affected.

BOMB will be burned after use.&#x20;

The weight for generating $MT of the NFT which uses one BOMB will increase by 1.

### How to obtain

#### 1. LPDA

Through a Last Price Dutch Auction (LPDA), starting from 1 million $MT, 100 bombs will be auctioned off each round, with the price decreasing by 1% per minute. BOMBs can be minted at any time in quantities less than the remaining tokens for the current round.

Once all the 100 bombs are auctioned out, the next round will automatically start. Transactions that bid higher than the current minimum bid will receive an $MT refund for the difference.

#### 2. BUY

Users can buy BOMB on marketplaces such as OpenSea.

## Land

Land, an ERC-721 NFT with a fixed total supply of 10,981 and consisting of 91 tiles, serves as a tax tool.

After a land is minted, NFTs can be placed on its tiles, and the land NFT will display the occupying alliance.

The land holder can receive 5% of the $MT generated by NFTs placed on the 91 tiles on it.

All land NFTs are issued through two methods: ETH curve minting and $MT auction minting.

### How to obtain

#### 1. ETH Curve Minting

Pricing starts at 0.02 ETH, with a price increase of 1â€° for each completed ETH curve mint. ETH curve minting will be available soon.

Through a Dutch auction, starting from 10 million $MT, one land will be auctioned off each round, with the price decreasing by 1% per minute. When the current $MT Auction Minting is complete, the next round will automatically start.
