# Account System

## Account

Anyone can play MOPN after connecting ethereum wallet (MetaMask or WalletConnect) as his or her account.

## Avatar

Each PFP NFT is an avatar in MOPN.

In one account, there may be multiple avatars.&#x20;

Players can place avatar on the map to occupy region, and can also remove avatar from the map.&#x20;

If the NFT is transferred from the wallet, the related avatar will also disappear from the account.&#x20;

All the operations, like placing and removing avatar on the map, only need approval of holding NFT instead of transfer or authorization.

## Bond

The avatar in MOPN is soul bond with the NFT itself, doesn't bond with the account.&#x20;

If NFT is transferred from wallet A to B, players can still operate the avatar by connecting wallet B.&#x20;

If the NFT is burned on chain, the related avatar will also be removed from the map.

## Alliance

NFTs from the same Collection are treated as one Alliance.

## Attributes

* ATT: Damage to HP of the enemy
* HP: when HP=0, avatar is dead and the NFT will be removed from the map
* STA: 1 cost of STA to move 1 block on the map
