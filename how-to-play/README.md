## Gameplay

To set up an [Avatar](account-system.md#avatar) in MOPN, all you need to do is to choose an NFT from your wallet.

NFTs from the same Collection are treated as one [Alliance](account-system.md#alliance). The core gameplay is to occupy more[ Blocks](map-system.md#block) on the [Map](map-system.md#map) through [War](game-system.md#war).

[$ENERGY](../economic-system/usdenergy/) can be distributed to the [Alliance](account-system.md#alliance) members based on occupied [Blocks](map-system.md#block) of the collection.

[$ENERGY](../economic-system/usdenergy/) can be used to buy [POM](../economic-system/prop/) in [Auction House](../economic-system/prop/prop-auction.md). [POM](../economic-system/prop/) will gain advantages for [avatars](account-system.md#avatar) to occupy more [Blocks](map-system.md#block).
