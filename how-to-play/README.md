## Gameplay

To set up an [Avatar](account-system.md#avatar) in MOPN, you need to choose NFT on the [Collection list](../economic-system/pass/community-governance.md) selected by community from your wallet.

NFTs from the same Collection are treated as one [Alliance](account-system.md#alliance). The core gameplay is to occupy more[ Blocks](map-system.md#block) on the [Map](map-system.md#map) through [War](game-system.md#war).

[$ENERGY](../economic-system/usdenergy/) can be distributed to the [Alliance](account-system.md#alliance) members based on occupied [Blocks](map-system.md#block) of the collection.

[$ENERGY](../economic-system/usdenergy/) can be used to buy [Props](../economic-system/prop/) in [Auction House](../economic-system/prop/prop-auction.md) (using Last Price Dutch Auction Pattern). [Props](prop-system.md) will gain advantages for players to occupy more blocks.
